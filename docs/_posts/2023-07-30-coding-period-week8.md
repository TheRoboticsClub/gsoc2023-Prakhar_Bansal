**Initializing the Electron Structure and Redirecting the Academy**

In the following week, I initialized the basic structure of how the Electron would work. This involved creating a new project, installing the necessary dependencies, and setting up the basic files and folders. I also created a simple script that would redirect the Academy website to the Electron app. This allowed me to test the app and make sure that it was working properly.

**Packaging and Serving the Electron App as an EXE File**

Once the app was working properly, I needed to package it so that users could download and install it on their own computers. I did this by using the Electron Packager tool. The Packager tool allowed me to create a distributable EXE file that contained all of the necessary files and dependencies for the app to run.

**Trial and Error**

The process of initializing the Electron structure and redirecting the Academy was not without its challenges. I encountered a number of errors along the way, which I had to troubleshoot. I also had to make a number of changes to the code in order to get everything working properly. However, after multiple trial and error, I was eventually able to get the app working as desired.

## Work Done


  - Initial structure: Lay the foundation of the desktop application by creating the necessary files and folders.
  - Packing the structure: Create a distributable version of the application by packaging the initial structure.
  - validating the working: Test the application to make sure that it is working properly.



## Learnings

-The importance of trial and error. The process of initializing the Electron structure and redirecting the Academy was not without its challenges. I encountered a number of errors along the way, which I had to troubleshoot. I also had to make a number of changes to the code in order to get everything working properly. However, after multiple trial and error, I was eventually able to get the app working as desired. This experience taught me the importance of perseverance and not giving up when things get tough.

-The importance of documentation. The Electron framework has a lot of documentation available, but it can be overwhelming to know where to start. I found it helpful to read the documentation carefully and to take notes on the things that I didn't understand. I also found it helpful to search for other people's experiences with Electron. This helped me to learn from others and to avoid making the same mistakes.

## Plan for Next week

- Write a Script for the User to run App
