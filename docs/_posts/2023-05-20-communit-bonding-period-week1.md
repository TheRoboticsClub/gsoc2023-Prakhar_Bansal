Hi everyone , I am excited to work on this project with JdeRobot Community to help build a cross-platform desktop application using Electron.js to make the site accessible to all with minimal technological requirements.

## Work Done

* Explore the current architecture of the site
* Learned and debuged the electron framework
* Got well acquinted with running, building and debugging Docker Images





Tested the electron activity using RADI and learned the functioning and requirements while running a application on different kernels

## Plan for next week

* 
* Possibility of drone exercises migration.
