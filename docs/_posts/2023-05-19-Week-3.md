In the weekly meet on 19th May With Apporv we discussed My first task would be to run an electron instance using Docker,And I thought to myself how difficult it could be until it turned out to be the most difficult yet quite a learning experience I've had in my journey of programming.

## Work Done

* Created a Electron Instance using Docker

## Learnings

* Electron is based on chromium which has a mutli-process architercture i.e the processes are run with some restrictions so to enable them the user has to manually change the permission first.
* The user needs to download X-launch to run an Electron App using Docker.
* But Before using X-launch you need to setup up its initial configuration. 

### Plan for next week

* Run an Electron Activity as frontend and Django as backend
